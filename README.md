# Tesseract : Towards Universal Atomic Composability
*A Formal Model for Multi-Rollup Environments on Ethereum*

In the rapidly evolving domain of distributed ledger technology, scalability and interoperability have become paramount challenges for both academic and industry sectors. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive formal model to address atomic composability across multiple rollups on Ethereum. The proposed model incorporates mechanisms like buffering, dependency management, concurrency control, and the groundbreaking zero-knowledge proofs. Moreover, we evaluate its practical repercussions, strengths, and weaknesses, ensuring resilience against manipulative or erroneous actions. The application of the proposed model to shared sequencers and other existing solutions accentuates its versatility and universality.
